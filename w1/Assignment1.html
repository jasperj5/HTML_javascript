    <p><a style="color: brown;"> My name is Jasper Jafferian I am 19 years old I live in Lincoln Rhode island I have one younger brother who love basketball.  I am a very energetic person who rarely gets upset. I also love to hang with my friends and play games I even started a gaming team with my friends called the clickers. when I made the clickers gaming team I got into making logos for a while and made my first logo at top of the page here I didnt have much software to do so but i used excel and paint. In highschool in my freshman year I played some sports I was part of the football team and partly on the wrestling team but didnt stay on it. My senoir year I did indoor track and feild.

    <p><a style="color: brown;">I have a great love for animals as a kid I wanted to be a vet but as I got older i realized I wouldnt be very good at it since I get to emotional around injured pets so I plan when I am older if I have a well paying job to open up a animal reserve since I love taking care of animals and interacting with them. In my life I have had alsorts of different pets I have had rabbits, guineapig, dogs, cats, frogs, and fish. Currently I have a cat and a ferret the cat is named tiger and the ferret is named snowball.</a></p>
