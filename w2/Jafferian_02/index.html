         <p> My name is Jasper Jafferian I am 19 years old I live in Lincoln Rhode island I have one younger brother whos love basketball.  I am a very energetic person who rarely gets upset. I also love to hang with my friends and play games I even started a gaming team with my friends called the clickers. when I made the clickers gaming team I got into making logos for a while and made my first logo at top of the page here I didnt have much software to do so but i used excel and paint. In highschool in my freshman year I played some sports I was part of the football team and partly on the wrestling team but didnt stay on it. My senoir year I did indoor track and feild.
